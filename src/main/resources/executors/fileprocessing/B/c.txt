Cats are mammals too. Their short fur can be of different colors – clear white, black,
red, grey and so on. Cats have no fins and wings, just legs, a body, a head with
whiskers and a long tail. They have 4 long legs, so they run quite fast. Sometimes
cats can be friendly and nice to people, sometimes – selfish. It depends on a cat's
temper. Cats are domestic animals, so they live with people – in people's houses and apartments.
They eat fish, meat, milk, sometimes – human food. Cats live for 10 - 15 years, but some of
them can live longer.

As for me, I have a pet too – I have got a red fluffy cat. His name is Ryjiy,
and it was named after his fur. My cat is four years old, he is very funny,
and sometimes he does crazy things. He likes to sleep with us and to look at
the window where colorful birds fly. Ryjiy is rather smart, and he knows the
time I feed him, and he goes to the kitchen before me. I like him very much and
I hope he will live a long and happy life.
