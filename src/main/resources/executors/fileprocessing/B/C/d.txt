Ozone layer or ozonosphere, region of the stratosphere containing relatively high
concentrations of ozone , located at altitudes of 12-30 mi (19-48 km) above the earth's
surface. Ozone in the ozone layer is formed by the action of solar ultraviolet light on oxygen.

The ozone layer prevents most ultraviolet (UV) and other high-energy radiation from penetrating
to the earth's surface but does allow through sufficient ultraviolet rays to support the activation
of vitamin D in humans. The full radiation, if unhindered by this filtering effect, would destroy
animal tissue. Higher levels of radiation resulting from the depletion of the ozone layer have been
linked with increases in skin cancers and cataracts and have been implicated in the decline of
certain amphibian species.
