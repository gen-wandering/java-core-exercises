Made of dust, ice, carbon dioxide, ammonia and methane, comets resemble
dirty snowballs. You may remember them as blurry smudges in the sky.
Comets orbit the Sun, but most are believed to inhabit in an area known
as the Oort Cloud, far beyond the orbit of Pluto. Occasionally a comet
streaks through the inner solar system; some do so regularly, some only
once every few centuries. Heads and tails As a comet nears the Sun, its
icy core boils off, forming a cloud of dust and gas called a head, or coma.
Comets become visible when sunlight reflects off this cloud. As the comet gets
closer to the sun, more gas is produced. The gas and dust is pushed away
by charged particles known as the solar wind, forming two tails. Dust particles
form a yellowish tail, and ionized gas makes a bluish ion tail. A comet's tails,
like these on comet Halley, always points away from the Sun. Meteor showers
When Earth crosses the path of a comet, even if the comet hasn't been around
for a few years, leftover dust and ice can create increased numbers of meteors.
